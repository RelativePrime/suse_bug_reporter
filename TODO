# TODO

What else can be done

## Offline mode

Allow the offline mode, where no network connection will be needed. This
can be activated by --offline switch and-or by first failure when
talking with a bugzilla.

The aim is to separate the gathering and the reporting, as most of
production machines are not connected to the network.

## Template reporting

The second part of the feature is ability to submit the generated
report. There's is some support, so maybe just test it.

## Version of the bugreporter tools in the report

To advertize it, there should be some information about a fact the bug
has been submitted using bugreport. For instance

X-SubmittedBy: bugreporter 1.5.rc4

## Work with crashdumps

Tool should scan dmesg output for recent crashes. Should it touch the
core_pattern as well?

## support for per-package hooks

Package could install their own information gathering functions. I think
this has been prepared, but not done.

Think: use /lib and /etc (system and user-specific hooks, like systemd
does?)

##
Integrate to yast support module (or whatever it is called)
- likely not before GUI is done

## Non technical stuff

advertise the tool once it gets to Factory
- blogpost
- release notes for 12.1
- mention it on the bugreporting wikipage
